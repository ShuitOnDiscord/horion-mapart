# Horion-Mapart

This project aims to convert MCEDIT Schematics generated by (MapartCraft)[https://rebane2001.com/mapartcraft/] to (Horion)[https://horion.download] NBT's so you can easily make maparts in minutes in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

Quick note:

This does **not** convert litematica files, this is only meant for schmatics generated by MapartCraft and will probably not work well with schematics that contain buildings.
