# Horion-Mapart

This project aims to convert MCEDIT Schematics generated by [MapartCraft](https://rebane2001.com/mapartcraft/) to [Horion](https://horion.download) NBT's so you can easily make maparts in minutes in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

---

Quick note:

This does **not** convert litematica files, this is only meant for schmatics generated by MapartCraft and will probably not work well with schematics that contain buildings.

Support may be added in the future for litematics, which is why theres a test litematic in the project directory. But as of now, no support is given for them.
